# music_lstm

This is a project for my Deep Learning class. I am using an LSTM to generate music. 
More specifically, I will be training the model on Bach's cello suites using raw audio (reduced to 8 bits) as 
opposed to the traditional approach of using MIDI. The goal is to then generate music in the style of the cello
suites.
